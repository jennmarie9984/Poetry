<H1 style="text-align:center">A Thunder-Storm</H1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">By &expectation;mily &expectation;lizabeth &Dscr;ickinson</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"> The wind begun to rock the grass<br/>
With threatening tunes and low,<br/>
He flung a menace at the the earth,<br/>
A menace at the sky.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> The leaves unhooked themselves from the trees <br/>
And started all abroad;<br/>
The dust did scoop itself like hands<br/>
And throw away the road.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> The wagons quickened on the streets,<br/>
The thunder hurried slow;<br/>
The lightning showed a yellow beak,<br/>
And then a livid claw.</p>


<p style="text-align:center">The birds put up the bars to nests,<br/>
The cattle fled to barns;<br/>
There came one drop of giant rain,<br/>
And then, as if the hands</p>

<p style="text-align:center">That held the dams had parted hold,<br/>
The waters wrecked the sky,<br/>
But overlooked my fathers house,<br/>
just quartering a tree.</p>
